The main ingredients in red velvet cake are butter, sugar, flour, eggs, unsweetened cocoa, baking powder, sometimes buttermilk, and, most importantly, a generous amount of red food coloring (gel or paste) to give the cake its typical color. Some recipes add cooked red beets to the batter to enhance the red color or vinegar to increase the cake's acidity and aid the leavening process.
